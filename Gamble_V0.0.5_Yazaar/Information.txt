Welcome to a gamble script made by Yazaar.

Please read this document before using the script!
I will not waste your time.

You can open this document up with "!gamble instructions" (limited to caster)

This gamble script is really advanced to make the experiece as good as possible.

All settings can be changed by specific commands and those can be found in this document.

The only ones who can change these are the caster and the editors.
