How to install my scripts (method 1): <br />
1. Install the PyInstaller script through method 2 <a href="https://github.com/Yazaar/Streamlabs-Chatbot-Scripts/blob/PyInstaller/PyInstaller.zip?raw=true">(DOWNLOAD)</a>
2. type "!pyinstall [script name]" in your chat to automatically install the script! <a href="https://yazaar.github.io/Streamlabs-PyInstaller-Properties/">(SCRIPTNAMES)</a>
3. DONE! Do the same with other scripts on this list: https://yazaar.github.io/Streamlabs-PyInstaller-Properties/

How to install my scripts (method 2): <br />
1. Go to the script you want to download (press the link) <br />
2. Press the green button named "Clone or Download" and press "Download ZIP" <br />
3. Go to the downloaded file and open the ZIP file. <br />
4. Find a ZIP file inside the downloaded ZIP file. Drag out that ZIP file. <br />
5. Open streamlabs chatbot and go to the scripts tab <br />
6. Press the import button found top right, locate the ZIP-file you dragged out and press OPEN. <br />
I could not find the ZIP file if the chatbot and the ZIP was on different disks, place them in the same if issues occurs! <br />
