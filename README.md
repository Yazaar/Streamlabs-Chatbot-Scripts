This is my very own gamble script. <br /> <br />

Includes: <br />
!gamble [amount]  >> Like every single gamble script... <br />
!gamble [minbet] [maxbet] >> Special function where you can gamble a random amount within the written range! <br /> <br />

[amount], [minbet] and [maxbet] can also be a percentage such as 25% or 13.37% and so on... <br />
That will calculate the chosen percentage of your total points and gamble that. <br />
You can also input all to gamble all of your available points! <br /> <br />

All settings is possible to change thru the chatbot.
